# The "Wheel" of Positional Sparring

The "Wheel" of Positional Sparring is a little side project created as an outlet for me to do Brazilian jiujitsu-ajacent things while recovering from surgery; inspired by an actual dry-erase wheel used in my gym for our positional/situational sparring.  

Let's say you're an instructor and you're trying to figure out what to cover during class, or maybe you and a training partner are trying to figure out what to work on during open mat--this smol app will pull a random position from a designated list of common mat situations for you to work on. For each position, there is also objectives designated for the person on offense and the person on defense.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Disclaimer

**As with any sort of physical activity, please use common sense.** By using to the "Wheel" of Positional Sparring as part of your jiujitsu training, you are training at your own risk and I (as well as any other contributers to this project) am not liable for any sort of injury or harm you sustain during training. This project also assumes that the user has been to a couple of jiujitsu classes and has some familiarity with the positions (if you've never done jiujitsu I implore you to [find a school nearby](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=brazilian+jiu+jitsu+schools+near+me) and take classes before using this app).  

Please be mindful about any sort of rules that the gym you are training at has with regards to certain positions. Specifically, if you train at a gym where leg locks are frowned upon and/or you need to be a certain belt rank to practice them, please spin again if you get 50/50 and you don't meet the requirements to be practicing leg locks. If there's something else you can practice in 50/50 that isn't leg locks, by all means go for it.
